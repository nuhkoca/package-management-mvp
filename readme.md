# SuitePad Java/Android Developer Code Review Assessment

The included code was intentionally written with several layers of bad
implementation. Please take 30 minutes to review and write up your assessment of
the included Android code. We're less interested in code semantics (e.g. "I
would add a comma here") and more interested in your assessment of code
structure, API utilization and how you would consider improving it and why.

Again, this should take approximately 30 minutes. This does not need to be a
formal write-up - simple bullet points of your thoughts are enough.

Good luck! We're eager to hear from you.
